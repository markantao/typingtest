> **Overview of the Project**
Typing Test is a terminal run typing game which tests your typing skills by giving you random text and testing your typing speed by using a "words per minute" algorithm. This project used modules such as **curses**, ***random**, and **time**. This project also uses a txt file to generate the random text. This is an overview of the project.
