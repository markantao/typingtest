Welcome back to another video! This is Mark Antao.
What did u guys think of this project? Would you want to see a full tutorial on curses in the future?! 
I was following along and really enjoyed the simplicity of what we are doing and learned alot.
This was one of the best videos ever this is really awesome for beginners.
Thanks a lot, I started learning Python several months ago and want to become a specialist.
